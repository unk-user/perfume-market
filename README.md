* **Shop Page:** Displays a list of available perfumes with basic information (image, name, price).
* **Product Page:** Provides detailed information about a specific perfume, including description and additional images.
* **Cart:** Shows all added items with their quantities and individual prices, calculating the total cost.

**Technologies:**

* **Frontend:** React (with Vite), Tailwind CSS
* **Data Acquisition:** Web Scraping (implementation details not included due to ethical considerations)

2. Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn install`)

**Running the App:**

2. The app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000/

**Note:**

* Web scraping is not included in this codebase due to ethical considerations. You'll need to implement your own data fetching mechanism (e.g., using an API) to populate the app with product information.

**Additional Notes:**
