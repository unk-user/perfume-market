## Perfume Market App - README

**Project Overview:**

This is a perfume market application built using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and web scraping techniques. It allows users to browse a collection of perfumes, view individual product details, add items to a cart, and see the total price.

**Features:**

* **Landing Page:** Introduces the app and showcases featured perfumes.
* **Shop Page:** Displays a list of available perfumes with basic information (image, name, price).
* **Product Page:** Provides detailed information about a specific perfume, including description and additional images.
* **Cart:** Shows all added items with their quantities and individual prices, calculating the total cost.

**Technologies:**

* **Frontend:** React (with Vite), Tailwind CSS
* **Data Acquisition:** Web Scraping (implementation details not included due to ethical considerations)
